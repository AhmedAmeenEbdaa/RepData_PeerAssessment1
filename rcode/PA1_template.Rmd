## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document.It contains all steps that I did with dataset

1- First loading data


```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
 myDataSet <- read.csv('data/activity.csv')
```


2- Converting data variable from character to  data 


```{r}
  myData <- transform(myDataSet , date = as.Date(date))
```


3- Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day


```{r}
daysWithTotalSteps <- summarize(group_by(myData,date),stepsTotal = sum(steps,na.rm =  TRUE))
ggplot(daysWithTotalSteps, aes(date, stepsTotal)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
```


4-Mean and median number of steps taken each day
```{r}
daysWithMainAndMEdianSteps <- summarize(group_by(myData,date),stepsMean = mean(steps,na.rm =  TRUE),stepsMedian = median(steps,na.rm =  TRUE))
daysWithMainAndMEdianSteps
```


5- Time series plot of the average number of steps taken
```{r}
intervalsWithMainSteps <- summarize(group_by(myData,interval),stepsMean = mean(steps,na.rm =  TRUE))
plot( intervalsWithMainSteps$stepsMean ~ intervalsWithMainSteps$interval,type="l")
```


6-The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
between 500 and 1000


7-A Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data


```{r}
numberOfNaSteps = sum(is.na(myData$steps))
propOfNaSteps = numberOfNaSteps / length(myData$steps)
```
The total number of missing values in the dataset is `r numberOfNaSteps` of `r length(myData$steps)` and its prop is `r propOfNaSteps`


7-B,7-C

I fill the missing values with the mean for that 5-minute interval.


```{r}
#loop through all rows
  for ( i in 1:nrow(myData)) {
    #check if steps variable is na
    if(is.na(myData[i,][1])) {
      
      #fill the steps variable with its corresponding mean interval
       myData[i,][1] = intervalsWithMainSteps$stepsMean[which(intervalsWithMainSteps$interval == myData[i,][3]$interval)] 
    }
  }
```

7-D Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day


```{r}
daysWithTotalStepsOfNewDataSet <- summarize(group_by(myData,date),stepsTotal = sum(steps))
ggplot(daysWithTotalStepsOfNewDataSet, aes(date, stepsTotal)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
```


7-E Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day

```{r}
daysWithMainAndMEdianStepsOfNewDataSet <- summarize(group_by(myData,date),stepsMean = mean(steps),stepsMedian = median(steps))
daysWithMainAndMEdianStepsOfNewDataSet
```


7-F

Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

The weekends of the old dataset which have NA values, have been filled with values.

8-A

Creating a new weedays column that contains weekday, weekend values.

```{r}
myData <- transform(myData , weekdays = ifelse(weekdays(date) %in% c("Saturday","Sunday"),"weekend","weekday"))
myData$weekdays <-as.factor(myData$weekdays)
```

8-B

Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. \color{red}{\verb|type = "l"|}type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis)

```{r}
intervalsWithMainSteps <- summarize(group_by(myData,weekdays,interval),stepsMean = mean(steps))
g<- ggplot(intervalsWithMainSteps, aes( intervalsWithMainSteps$interval, intervalsWithMainSteps$stepsMean)) 
g + geom_line()  + facet_grid(weekdays ~ .)  +   xlab("Interval") + ylab("Number of steps")
```
